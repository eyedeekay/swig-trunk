<h1>SWIG for Windows </h1>
<h2>Windows Executable</h2>
The SWIG windows executable comes as a separate download which can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG website</a>.<p>

SWIG can also be compiled and run using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> which provides a Unix like front end to Windows.

<h2>SWIG Windows Examples</h2>
Using Microsoft Visual C++ is the most successful approach to compiling and linking SWIG's output. The Examples directory has a few Visual C++ project files (.dsp files). These were produced by Visual C++ 6, although they should also work in Visual C++ 5. These project files have been set up to use SWIG in a custom build for the SWIG interface (.i) file.<p>

More information on each of the examples is available on the <a href="../Examples/index.html">SWIG Examples</a> page.

<h2>Instructions for using the Examples from Visual C++</h2>
Ensure the SWIG executable is unzipped and placed in the SWIG root directory for 
the examples to work. Each language requires some environmemnt variables to be set before opening Visual C++. Note that Visual C++ must be re-started to pick up any changes in environment variables. Open up the .dsp file, Visual C++ will create a workspace for you (.dsw file). Do a Rebuild All from the Build menu. The environment variables that need setting are displayed with their current values. <p>

The list of required environment variables for each module language are listed below.  They are usually set from the Control Panel and System properties, but this depends on which flavour of Windows you are running. If you don't want to use environment variables then change all occurences of the environment variables in the .dsp files with hard coded values.

<h3>Python</h3>
