This example runs the entire gifplot.h header file through SWIG without
any changes.  The program 'runme.java' does something a little more 
interesting. Run it using 'java runme'. You'll have to go look at the header 
file to get a complete listing of the functions.

Note the differences in the runme.java files between this example and the  
'full' example. This example does not use shadow classes.
