SWIG Mailing Lists

<p><img src="images/mail.png" alt="Mail">

<p>

There are a number of mailing lists available. Please use them for any queries related to the use or development of SWIG.

<p>
<b>Important</b>. The mailing lists are set with a very high level of spam rejection, meaning occasionally some SWIG user's email postings will be discarded. Emails classified as spam are quietly discarded, so please check the archives if you are unsure as to whether or not your email was successfully posted. Note that only plain text emails should be sent, that is html, rtf etc formatted emails may be quietly discarded. The mailing lists are also subscriber only lists, so you must subscribe to the relevant list in order to post to that list. 

<p>
Note that in November 2005 new mailing lists replaced the original mailing lists.
Details of <a href="#search_lists">searching or browsing</a> both the new and old lists are given below.
</p>

<p>
To subscribe to any of the mailing lists or view the archives, use the links on the left column.

<h2><a name="top_bottom_posting">Top posting and bottom posting</h2>
<p>
Replies to emails can be either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-posting#Bottom-posting">bottom or top posted</a>.
The SWIG community by and large uses bottom postings or inline replies.
This doesn't mean top postings are ruled out, however, an email chain with both top and bottom postings is rather difficult to follow and should be avoided.
Please don't mix top and bottom posts in one thread, stick with whichever approach the first reply used.
</p>

<p>
For those who are new to mailing lists, there are many articles on the subject, for example,
<a href="http://www.caliburn.nl/topposting.html">Bottom vs. top posting and quotation style on Usenet</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/usenet/brox.html">Why is Bottom-posting better than Top-posting</a>.

</p>

<h2><a name="search_lists">Searching and browsing the mailing lists</h2>
<p>
The mailing lists can be searched in various different ways.
The links below are shortcuts to the archives from where you can easily search or browse the archives of postings from November 2005 onwards.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=swig-user">swig-user archives</a>
<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=swig-devel">swig-devel archives</a>
<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=swig-cvs">swig-cvs archives</a>
</p>

<p>
The original mailing lists in use prior to November 2005 are partially archived. 
These old lists and the new lists can be searched at the same time using <a href="http://www.gmane.org">Gmane</a>:
</p>

<!-- SiteSearch Gmane -->
<FORM method=GET action="http://search.gmane.org">
<TABLE bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><tr>
<td>
<INPUT TYPE=text name=query size=31 maxlength=255 value="">
<INPUT type=submit VALUE="Gmane Search">
<br>
<font size=-1>
<input type=radio name=group value="gmane.comp.programming.swig" checked> swig-user mailing list <input type=radio name=group value="gmane.comp.programming.swig.devel"> swig-devel mailing list <br>
</font>
</td></tr></TABLE>
</FORM>
<!-- SiteSearch Gmane -->

<!-- no longer works as the University of Chicago has removed the mailing lists
<p>
The original mailing lists in use prior to November 2005 are still archived and available for browsing from the links below.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/mailman/pipermail/swig">swig archives</a> - swig-user equivalent
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/mailman/pipermail/swig-dev">swig-dev archives</a> - swig-devel equivalent
<br>
</p>

These lists can be searched in two different ways.
The most thorough approach is to use Google to search the web site that hosts these old list archives.
</p>

<p>
The Gmane interface to the <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.programming.swig">old swig and new swig-user mailing lists</a>
and the <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.programming.swig.devel"> old swig-dev and new swig-devel mailing lists</a> 
can also be used to browse online as if the list was a newsgroup. Note that the old swig-dev archive is <b>incomplete</b>.
</p>

<p>
The swig-user mailing list can also be browsed and searched using <a href="http://www.nabble.com/SWIG-f3365.html">Nabble</a>.
