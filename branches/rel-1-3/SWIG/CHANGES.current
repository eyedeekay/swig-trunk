Version 1.3.15 (In progress)
================================
08/17/2002: beazley
            Fixed [ 596135 ] Typedef of reference can't compile.  For example:

                 typedef int &IntRef;
                 void foo(IntRef i);

            SWIG-1.3.14 generated code that wouldn't compile.
