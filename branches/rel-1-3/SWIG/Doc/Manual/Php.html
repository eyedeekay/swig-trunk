In this chapter, we discuss SWIG's support of PHP4. The PHP4 module is 
still under development so some of the features below may not work properly
(or at all!.)

<a name="n1"></a><h2> Preliminaries</h2>
In order to use this module, you will need to have a copy of the PHP 4.0 (or above) include files to compile the SWIG generated files. To test the modules
you will need either the php binary or the Apache php module. If you want to
build your extension into php directly (without having the overhead of loading
it into each script), you will need the complete PHP source tree available.

<a name="n2"></a><h2> Building PHP4 Extensions</h2>
To build a PHP4 extension, run swig using the <tt>-php4</tt> option as follows :
<p>
<blockquote><pre>
swig -php4 example.i

</pre></blockquote>
This will produce 5 files by default. The first file, <tt>example_wrap.c</tt> contains all of the C code needed to build a PHP4 extension. The second file, <tt>php_example.h</tt> contains the header information needed to link the extension into PHP.
The third file, <tt>config.m4</tt> contains the shell code needed to enable 
the extension as part of the PHP4 build process. The fourth file, <tt>Makefile.in</tt> contains the information needed to build the final Makefile after substitutions. The fifth and final file, <tt>CREDITS</tt> should contain the credits for
the extension. The last three files are only needed for the build process and
you can stop then from being generated by passing the '-noextra' command line
switch.
<p>
To finish building a extension, you have two choices. You can either build the 
extension as a seperate object file which will then have to be explicitly loaded
by each script. Or you can rebuild the entire php source tree and build the 
extension into the php executable/library so it will be available in every 
script.  The first choice is the default, however it can be changed by passing 
the '-phpall' command line switch to select the second build method.

<a name="n3"></a><h3>Building a loadable extension</h3>

In order to complete the compilation, after you have run swig you will need
to run the 'phpize' command (installed as part of php ) in the same
directory. This re-creates the php build environment in that directory. It also
creates a configure file which includes the shell code from the config.m4 that
was generated by SWIG, this configure script will accept a command line argument
to enable the extension to be run ( by default the command line argument is 
--enable-modulename, however you can edit the config.m4 file before running 
phpize to accept --with-modulename. You can also add extra tests in config.m4 
to check that a correct library version is installed or correct header files
are included, etc, but you must edit this file before running phpize. )
<p>
Before running the generated configure file, you may need to edit the <tt>
Makefile.in</tt> file. This contains the names of the source files to compile 
(just the wrapper file by default) and any additional libraries needed to be
linked in. If there are extra C files to compile, you will need to add them
to the Makefile.in, or add the names of libraries if they are needed.
<p>
You then run the configure script with the command line argument needed
to enable the extension. Then run make, which builds the extension.
The extension object file will be left in the modules sub directory, you can
move it to wherever it is convenient to call from your php script. To test
the extension from a PHP script, you need to load it first. You do this
by putting the line,
<blockquote><pre>
	dl("/path/to/modulename.so");	// Load the module
</pre></blockquote>

at the start of each PHP file.

<a name="n4"></a><h3>Building extension into php</h3>

This method, selected with the '-phpall' command line switch, involves
rebuilding the entire php source tree. Whilst more complicated to build,
it does mean that the extension is then available without having to load it 
in each script. 
<p>
After running swig with the -phpall switch, you will be left with a shockingly
similiar set of files to the previous build process. However you will then need
to move these files to a subdirectory within the php source tree, this subdirectory you will need to create under the ext directory, with the name of the extension ( e.g mkdir php-4.0.6/ext/modulename .)
<p>
After moving the files into this directory, you will need to run the 'buildall'
script in the php source directory. This rebuilds the configure command
and includes the extra command line arguments from the module you have added. 
<p>
Before running the generated configure file, you may need to edit the <tt>
Makefile.in</tt>. This contains the names of the source files to compile (
just the wrapper file by default) and any additional libraries needed to
link in. If their are extra C files to complile you will need to add them
to the Makefile, or add the names of libraries if they are needed.
<p>
You then need to run the configure command and pass the necessary command
line arguments to enable your module ( by default this is --enable-modulename,
but this can be changed by editing the config.m4 file in the modules directory
before running the buildall script. In addition, extra tests can be added to
the config.m4 file to ensure the correct libraries and header files are 
installed.)
<p>
Once configure has completed, you can run make to build php. If this all
compiles correctly, you should end up with a php executable/library
which contains your new module. You can test it with a php script which
does not have the 'dl' command as used above.
