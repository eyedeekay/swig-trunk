<h1>Getting started on Windows </h1>
<h2>Installation on Windows</h2>
Installing SWIG on Windows is not difficult, but it does not come with the usual Windows type installation program. The main steps are:
<ul>
        <li>Download main SWIG package from the <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG website</a> and unzip tarball.
        <li>Download prebuilt Windows executable and unzip into the same directory. Ensure the swig.exe file is in the SWIG root directory, that is the same directory as the <tt>configure.in</tt> and main <tt>README</tt> files.
        <li>Set environment variables in order to run some examples using Visual C++ as <a href="#windows10">described</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Windows Executable</h3>
The SWIG windows executable, swig.exe, comes as a separate download which can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG website</a>. Alternatively build your own swig.exe using the <a href="#cygwin100">supplied instructions</a>, but this is not a recommended approach.
<p>


<h2>SWIG Windows Examples</h2>
Using Microsoft Visual C++ is the most successful approach to compiling and linking SWIG's output. The Examples directory has a few Visual C++ project files (.dsp files). These were produced by Visual C++ 6, although they should also work in Visual C++ 5. These project files have been set up to use SWIG in a custom build rule for the SWIG interface (.i) file.<p>

More information on each of the examples is available with the examples on the <a href="../../Examples/index.html">SWIG Examples</a> page.

<p>
Note that no SWIG language runtime libraries have been supplied. The examples which have
a Microsoft Visual C++ project file do not need the runtime libraries. In fact the 
vast majority of the examples do not need the SWIG runtime libraries.

<a name="#windows10"></a><h2>Instructions for using the Examples from Visual C++</h2>
Ensure the SWIG executable is unzipped and placed in the SWIG root directory as described earlier for 
the examples to work. Each language requires some environment variables to be set <b>before</b> running Visual C++. Note that Visual C++ must be re-started to pick up any changes in environment variables. Open up the .dsp file, Visual C++ will create a workspace for you (.dsw file). Do a Rebuild All from the Build menu. The environment variables that need setting are displayed with their current values. <p>

The list of required environment variables for each module language are listed below.  They are usually set from the Control Panel and System properties, but this depends on which flavour of Windows you are running. If you don't want to use environment variables then change all occurences of the environment variables in the .dsp files with hard coded values.

<h3>Python</h3>
<b><tt>PYTHON_INCLUDE</tt></b> : Set this to the directory that contains python.h<br>
<b><tt>PYTHON_LIB</tt></b> : Set this to the python library including path for linking with<p>
Example using Python 2.1.1:<br>
<tt>
PYTHON_INCLUDE: d:\python21\include<br>
PYTHON_LIB: d:\python21\libs\python21.lib<br>
</tt>

<h3>TCL</h3>
<b><tt>TCL_INCLUDE</tt></b> : Set this to the directory containing tcl.h<br>
<b><tt>TCL_LIB</tt></b> : Set this to the TCL library including path for linking with<p>
Example using ActiveTcl 8.3.3.3	<br>
<tt>
TCL_INCLUDE: d:\tcl\include<br>
TCL_LIB: d:\tcl\lib\tcl83.lib<br>
</tt>

<h3>Perl</h3>
<b><tt>PERL5_INCLUDE</tt></b> : Set this to the directory containing perl.h and perl.lib<br>
Example using nsPerl 5.004_04:<p>
<tt>
PERL5_INCLUDE: D:\nsPerl5.004_04\lib\CORE<br>
</tt>

<h3>Java</h3>
<b><tt>JAVA_INCLUDE</tt></b> : Set this to the directory containing jni.h<br>
<b><tt>JAVA_BIN</tt></b> : Set this to the bin directory containing javac.exe<p>
Example using JDK1.3:<br>
<tt>
JAVA_INCLUDE: d:\jdk1.3\include<br>
JAVA_BIN: d:\jdk1.3\bin<br>
</tt>

<h3>Ruby</h3>
<b><tt>RUBY_INCLUDE</tt></b> : Set this to the directory containing ruby.h<br>
<b><tt>RUBY_LIB</tt></b> : Set this to the ruby library including path for linking with<p>
Example using Ruby 1.6.4:<br>
<tt>
RUBY_INCLUDE: D:\ruby\lib\ruby\1.6\i586-mswin32<br>
RUBY_LIB: D:\ruby\lib\mswin32-ruby16.lib<br>
</tt>

<h2>SWIG on Cygwin and Mingw</h2>
SWIG can also be compiled and run using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> which provides a Unix like front end to Windows. This is not a recommended approach as the prebuilt executable is supplied and many of the modules do not work under Cygwin due to difficulties in building Dynamic Link Libraries (dlls). Currently only the Java module is known to work, some of the others may or may not.

<a name="cygwin100"></a><h3>Building swig.exe on Windows</h3>
If you want to replicate the build of swig.exe that comes with the download, follow the following instructions.
This is not necessary to use the supplied swig.exe. This information is provided for 
those that want to modify the SWIG source code in a Windows environment. Normally this is not needed, so most people will want to ignore this section. 

<h4>Building swig.exe using Cygwin and Mingw</h4>
<ul>
        <li>Install <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
        <li>Install <a href="http://www.mingw.org">Mingw</a>
        <li>Ensure that the mingw bin directory is before the cygwin bin directory in your path.
        <li>Follow the usual Unix instructions to build the SWIG executable, ie from the SWIG root directory
        <blockquote><pre>
./configure
make
       </pre></blockquote>
</ul>
Note that SWIG can be built using just cygwin, ie no mingw installed. However, the 
SWIG executable will then require the cygwin DLL.
<p>

<h4>Building swig.exe alternatives</h4>
If you don't want to install cygwin and mingw, use a different compiler to build 
SWIG. For example, all the source code files can be added to a Visual C++ project 
file in order to build swig.exe from the Visual C++ IDE.

<h3>Running the examples on Windows using Cygwin and Mingw</h3>
Note that a 
<blockquote><pre>
make -k check
</pre></blockquote>
command is not very successful on Cygwin/mingw. The Makefiles need setting up by hand for some modules to get the dlltool to work correctly.
The recommended way is to use Visual C++ to compile the output from swig.exe.

<p>
Try running <tt>./autogen</tt> from the SWIG root directory before running <tt>./configure</tt> in order to use the latest autoconf and automake tools.
