This is an example of how un-initialized variables crash PHP. The
string in the class will point to garbage at the start, which will
then be attempted to be copied to PHP. The crash occurs in strlen as
it cannot find the (non-existent) string terminator. Ideas on fixing this
problem are welcome!. Until then pass the '-nosync' flag to swig and use
set/get to change object values if this problem occurs.
