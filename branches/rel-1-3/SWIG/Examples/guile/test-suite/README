This directory contains a test suite for SWIG.  The idea is that
whenever a bug in SWIG is discovered, we add a test that fails,
showing the bug.  When we believe to have fixed the bug, we can check
whether test works.  The tests are kept here when the bug is fixed --
so we can make sure that the bug (or related bugs) don't creep back
into SWIG.

This is an honest test suite.  It also contains tests for things that
are *known* to fail in the current version of SWIG.  They are here in
order to remind the maintainers to fix those problems in the next
versions. 

The following tests currently fail; please don't report them as bugs!

 * macro-2: SWIG FAILED
 * template-whitespace: SWIG FAILED
