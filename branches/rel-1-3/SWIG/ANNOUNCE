*** ANNOUNCE: SWIG 1.3.10 ***

December 10, 2001

Overview
--------
We're pleased to announce the next installment of the SWIG1.3
redevelopment effort.  The 1.3.10 release includes a large number of
major enhancements, especially for C++ extension building.  Some of
these changes include:

* Redesigned Typemaps *

The typemap system has been almost completely rewritten.  The major
improvement in this release is support for multi-argument typemaps.
This addresses the problem of wrapping functions where multiple arguments
might be mapped to a single object in the target language.  For example:

    void foo(char *buffer, int len);          // String and length
    void bar(int *ptr, int rows, int cols);   // Pointer and shape

This has been a long requested SWIG feature (for more than 4 years).
SWIG-1.3.10 is the first release that makes this easy.

* Overloaded Operators *

Overloaded operators can now be wrapped as easily as standard methods.
Simply give the operators an acceptable name.  For example:

    %rename(__add__) operator+;
    %rename(__sub__) operator-;
    ...

Some language modules provide automatic conversion of operators
to special methods.  However, this is experimental and in progress.

* Enhanced exception handling *

A new %exception directive allows exception handlers to be attached
to specific declarations.  For example:

   %exception getitem {
      try {
         $action
      } catch(RangeError) {
         ...
      }
    }

    class List {
    ...
      T getitem(int index);    <-- Exception handler added here
    ...
    };

This feature can greatly reduce the amount of generated code and allows
exception handling to be more finely tuned.

* PHP module *

SWIG-1.3.10 is the first release to include support for PHP4.  This work has
been contributed by Richard Palmer and is still in progress.   

* Improved internals *

SWIG is now building a complete parse tree of the interface before generating
any code.  The whole language module API has also been completely redesigned
to give the code generators greatly flexibility.   For now, you will only notice
superficial changes (e.g., the generated wrapper code is better).   However,
more amazing stuff is on the way.

* Partially updated documentation *

The first part of the SWIG manual has been updated to reflect new
features.  This is the first documentation update in 4 years.
However, updating the entire manual is an ongoing process and is not
yet finished in the 1.3.10 release.  Most new changes and
incompatibilities are documented however.

Availability:
-------------
The release is available for download on Sourceforge at

     http://download.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-1.3.10.tar.gz

Within the next day, a Windows version will also be made available at

     http://download.sourceforge.net/swig/swigwin-1.3.10.zip

What's broken?
--------------
This is the first release of SWIG that breaks backwards compatibility
with SWIG1.1 in a substantial manner.  Although we realize that this
may be painful, these incompatibilities are unavoidable due to 
corrections that needed to be made in order to fix semantic errors
in the SWIG1.1 implementation.   However, we hope that these
changes are a small price to pay for some of SWIG's new features including
support for C++ templates, overloading, and improved parsing.

As this is a work in progress, a number of features are still missing
or incomplete.  The documentation system is still missing and won't be
reimplemented for some time. C++ programmers who make extensive use of
typemaps may encounter a few strange problems (although SWIG will
generate warning messages).

The Perl5 module is also in some need of some repair and may not work
with all Perl configurations such as ActivePerl (It seems to work with
a standard Perl5.6.1 distribution however).  We are looking for a
fearless volunteer to help us with future Perl5 support (please skip
to the end for details).

The Java module is also undergoing some renovation and may not be
fully functional in this release.

Documentation
-------------
This release contains partially updated documentation.  Almost all new
SWIG features are described in the updated documentation.  The CHANGES
file contains a detailed log of changes and the README file contains
some additional information.  This is the first SWIG-1.3 release to
include the standard documentation in HTML format (now found in the
Doc directory).

New Development Process
-----------------------
Starting with SWIG1.3, we are adopting an odd/even version numbering
scheme for SWIG.  Odd version numbers (1.3, 1.5, 1.7, etc...) are
considered to be unstable development releases.  Even numbers
(1.4,1.6,1.8) are stable releases.  The current 1.3 effort is working
to produce a stable 1.4 release.  This will not happen until we can
get all of the documentation updated.  In the meantime, occasional
1.3.x releases will be made.

We need your help!
------------------
Even if you are perfectly happy with SWIG1.1, we can still use your
feedback.  First, we like to know about compilation problems and other
issues concerning the building of SWIG.  Second, if SWIG1.3 is unable
to compile your old interface files, we would like to get information
about the features you are using.  This information will help us find
bugs in the SWIG1.3 release, develop techniques for supporting
backwards compatibility, and write documentation that addresses
specific issues related to migrating from SWIG1.1 to SWIG1.3.

We are also looking for volunteers who would like to work on various
aspects of SWIG development.  SWIG is an unfunded project that would
not exist without volunteers.  We are also looking for the developers
of other SWIG language modules.  If you have developed a SWIG module
and would like to see it incorporated into the new release, please
contact us to obtain SWIG developer access.  We are also more than
willing to help port your module from SWIG1.1 to SWIG1.3.
