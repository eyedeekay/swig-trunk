SWIG code documentation project.

Author: Marko Klopcic


Introduction
============

The goal of this project is _not_ to translate _any_ possible doxygen
formatted comment to JavaDoc or PyDoc, but to make it possible to
translate a subset of comment types in C/C++ code to
JavaDoc and PyDoc. Covering all the Doxygen functionality would be to
complex for the limited time. Hovewer, the code must be extendable so
that implementing missing features would not require redesign of the
comment handling code in SWIG.

There will also be a possiblity to add untranslated comments to Java
and Python code (## comments, see Doxygen manual), if the user will
prefer to use Doxygen on the generated code.

Note:
time format below is HH:MM. '--Done' tick means that the item is
implemented, commited and working.

Abbreviations:
    JD - JavaDoc
    PD - PyDoc


Functionality
=============

  Types of comments
  -----------------
  
  Note:
     See 'http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html' for
     the detailed description of Doxygen syntax and terms used in this
     section.

  1. Only JavaDoc (/** */) and Qt (/*! */) styles of comment blocks
     will be supported by SWIG translator.
     --Done

  2. The following doc after members will be supported:
  
     int var; ///< Detailed description after the member
              //!< 

     int var; //!< Brief description after the member

     int var; ///< Brief description after the member
     
     --Done

  3. Only comments before or after declaration/definition will be
     supported. Comments with structural commands will be ignored
     (warning will be written). (What about writing them to
     'package.info.java' for JD?)
     --Done
  

  Tags
  ----

  This section contains all doxygen tags taken from 
  http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html. If a tag is
  marked as 'ignored', then the tag is ignored, but the text is copied
  to the destination documentation. 'Not implemented' means that the
  tag with it's contents is stripped out of the output.

The following test cases will be implemented:

- Class comments, JD and Qt style.
- Class comments, JD and Qt style.

- Struct comments, JD and Qt style.
- Enum comments, JD and Qt style.

- Class attributes, JD and Qt style, comment before and after declaration.

  after parameter declaration.
  
- Struct attributes, JD and Qt style, comment before and after declaration.
- Struct methods, JD and Qt style, comment of parameters in function
  comment.
- Struct methods, JD and Qt style, comment of parameters 
  after parameter declaration.

- Enum items JD and Qt style, comment before items
- Enum items JD and Qt style, comment after items

- Class comment, JD and Qt style, with all supported tags.
- Class comment, JD and Qt style, with all doxygen tags, including
  ignored ones.

  
Refactoring
===========

All the code in directory _DoxygenTranslator_ should be refactored:
- all methods should be class members
- most static methods should be normal members
- replace C arrays of strings and sequential searches with STL data
  structures and algorithms.
- use singletons instead of class instantiaion for each comment found.


Documentation
=============

SWIG documentation will contain:
- command line options
- list of implemented features (types and placements of comments)
- list of unimplemented features (types and placements of comments)
- list of tags and their translations (all Doxygen tags).
